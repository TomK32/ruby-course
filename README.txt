This are a few scripts that I'm using in a course teaching ruby to non-programmers.

If you want to use them as well, feel free to do so and if you think this or that could be
better, please fork the repository and let me know about your changes.

The scripts are ordered alphabetically, so start with "a-big-hello.rb" and go through.
